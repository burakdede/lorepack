# Continuous integration

The verification, benchmark, release and commit-hygiene workflows each own a separate gate. The
verification and benchmark workflows both run on pull requests. The release workflow consumes
their results before publishing.

## `ci.yml`

Runs on every pull request and every push to `main`, across a three-way OS matrix
(`ubuntu-latest`, `windows-latest`, `macos-latest`) on Node 24.21.0. `fail-fast` is off so
a Windows-only failure is visible even when Linux is green, which is the whole reason the
matrix exists.

Steps, in order:

1. Assert the resolved Node stays inside `>=24.19.0 <25`. A silent drift below the floor
   would bring back a bundled SQLite older than 3.53.2, with the FTS5 CVEs, so it fails
   loudly instead.
2. `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`
3. `pnpm lint`, `pnpm format:check`, `pnpm typecheck`
4. `pnpm test:arch`, the dependency-direction rules
5. `pnpm test`
6. `pnpm check:no-native`, `pnpm check:no-em-dash`

Test results and coverage upload as artifacts on every run, including failures.

The `privacy sandbox (ubuntu-latest)` job builds the project and runs
`tools/security/test/privacy-defaults.test.ts` inside a fresh network and mount namespace that
counts every packet (`tools/security/test/sandbox/netns.sh`). It is a separate job because it
needs `sudo`, and Linux only because that namespace has no macOS or Windows equivalent. See
[`security.md`](security.md#privacy-defaults).

## `benchmarks.yml`

Runs the shared evidence protocol on `ubuntu-latest`, `windows-latest` and `macos-latest`. Pull
requests use the small profile. Pushes to `main`, the schedule and manual dispatch use the medium
profile by default, with a large profile available only through explicit dispatch. Each runner
executes the Lorepack, direct FTS5 and offline RAG reports over the same commit, corpus and
workload. Raw JSON and a rendered summary are uploaded for 30 and 90 days respectively.

The summary keeps platform rows separate. It rejects missing protocol fields, mismatched commit or
corpus identity, unsupported artifacts and failed rollback evidence. It never averages unlike
machines. Downloaded artifacts can be checked and rendered locally with:

```sh
pnpm check:benchmark-artifacts <downloaded-directory> --summary summary.md
```

Hosted RAG runs are separate, manual-dispatch-only and protected by the `benchmark-hosted`
environment. Provider secrets are unavailable to pull-request and scheduled runs.

## Local coverage

Run `mise exec -- pnpm test:unit --coverage` under the supported Node 24 runtime. Vitest writes
the text summary and JSON report to `coverage/`; the directory is local output and is not
committed. The coverage provider is pinned to the same version as Vitest in the workspace so
this command exercises the configured report path rather than failing during startup.

## `commit-hygiene.yml`

Runs on pull requests only. Rejects AI attribution trailers and footers, and an em dash in
any commit message.

The attribution check matches patterns (`Co-Authored-By:`, `Generated with`, the robot
emoji) rather than the bare product name. `CLAUDE.md` is a legitimately committed file, so
matching the word alone would fail the build for mentioning it.

## Required checks

Branch protection on `main` requires a pull request and a linear history. As the workflows
stabilise, add these as required status checks:

- `verify (ubuntu-latest)`
- `verify (windows-latest)`
- `verify (macos-latest)`
- `no AI attribution`

Configure with:

```bash
gh api -X PUT repos/burakdede/lorepack/branches/main/protection \
  -F 'required_status_checks[strict]=true' \
  -F 'required_status_checks[contexts][]=verify (ubuntu-latest)' \
  -F 'required_status_checks[contexts][]=verify (windows-latest)' \
  -F 'required_status_checks[contexts][]=verify (macos-latest)' \
  -F 'required_pull_request_reviews[required_approving_review_count]=0' \
  -F enforce_admins=false -F restrictions=null -F required_linear_history=true
```

## Timing

The budget is under 10 minutes per job. There is no remote build cache, per architecture
section 8.1: add one only when measured timings demand it.

The credentialed Cloudflare acceptance harness shares one Worker across runs.
After Wrangler deploys it, the harness writes that Worker's actual endpoint into
the target receipt alongside its name. Deploy and resume confirm activation
against the same Worker that serves the acceptance requests.
