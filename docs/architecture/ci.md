# Continuous integration

Two workflows. Both must be green before a pull request merges.

## `ci.yml`

Runs on every pull request and every push to `main`, across a three-way OS matrix
(`ubuntu-latest`, `windows-latest`, `macos-latest`) on Node 24.18.1. `fail-fast` is off so
a Windows-only failure is visible even when Linux is green, which is the whole reason the
matrix exists.

Steps, in order:

1. Assert the resolved Node stays inside `>=24.15 <25`. A silent drift below the floor
   would remove the SQLite authorizer and `db.limits`, so it fails loudly instead.
2. `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`
3. `pnpm lint`, `pnpm format:check`, `pnpm typecheck`
4. `pnpm test:arch`, the dependency-direction rules
5. `pnpm test`
6. `pnpm check:no-native`, `pnpm check:no-em-dash`

Test results and coverage upload as artifacts on every run, including failures.

## `commit-hygiene.yml`

Runs on pull requests only. Rejects AI attribution trailers and footers, and an em dash in
any commit message.

The attribution check matches patterns (`Co-Authored-By:`, `Generated with`, the robot
emoji) rather than the bare product name. `CLAUDE.md` is a legitimately committed file, so
matching the word alone would fail the build for mentioning it.

## Required checks

Branch protection on `main` requires a pull request and a linear history. As the workflows
stabilise, add these as required status checks:

- `verify (ubuntu-latest)`
- `verify (windows-latest)`
- `verify (macos-latest)`
- `no AI attribution`

Configure with:

```bash
gh api -X PUT repos/burakdede/lorepack/branches/main/protection \
  -F 'required_status_checks[strict]=true' \
  -F 'required_status_checks[contexts][]=verify (ubuntu-latest)' \
  -F 'required_status_checks[contexts][]=verify (windows-latest)' \
  -F 'required_status_checks[contexts][]=verify (macos-latest)' \
  -F 'required_pull_request_reviews[required_approving_review_count]=0' \
  -F enforce_admins=false -F restrictions=null -F required_linear_history=true
```

## Timing

The budget is under 10 minutes per job. There is no remote build cache, per architecture
section 8.1: add one only when measured timings demand it.
